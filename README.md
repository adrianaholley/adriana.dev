## TL;DR

I'm a Software Engineer focusing on Android apps, with two years of experience.

I work at [Target](https://target.com)'s headquarters in Minneapolis, and I'm working on [their flagship Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.target.ui&hl=en_US&gl=US). I've added many features to the app and its build pipeline. 

In my free time, I work on making these projects better:
1. [an app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adriapolis.skywaymappgoogle&hl=en_US&gl=US) with over 9,000 downloads (it's a map for the Minneapolis skyway system)
2. [another app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adriapolis.skywaymapstpaul&hl=en_US&gl=US) similar to the one above, but written with Compose and with more features (a map of the St. Paul skyway system)
2. [a Covid Dashboard](https://ttucovid19.com) for Texas Tech University (a whole bunch of charts showing cases over time, which is way better than what the university was actually providing)
